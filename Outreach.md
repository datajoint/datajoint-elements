# Outreach Plan 

Broad engagement with the neuroscience community is necessary for the optimization, integration, and adoption of DataJoint Elements. 

We conduct five types of outreach activities that require different approaches:


# 1. Precursor Projects 
Our [Selection Process](Selection.md) requires a "Precursor Project" for any new experiment modality to be included in DataJoint Elements.
A precursor project is one that develops a DataJoint pipeline for its own experiments either independently or in collaboration with our team. 
We reach out to teams who develop DataJoint pipelines for new experiment paradigms and modalities to identify essential design motifs, analysis tools, and related tools and interfaces. 
We interview the core team to learn about their collaborative culture, practices, and procedures. 
We jointly review their open-source code and their plans for disseminating it.
In many cases, our team already collaborates with such teams through our other projects and we have a good understanding of their process. 
As we develop a new Element to support the new modality, we remain in contact with the team to include their contribution, solicit feedback, and evaluate design tradeoffs,  
When the new Element is released, a full attribution is given to the Precursor Project.


# 2. Tool Developers 
DataJoint pipelines rely on analysis tools, atlases, data standards, archives and catalogs, and other neuroinformatics resources developed and maintained by the broader scientific community.
We establish a working relationship 

# 3. Validation Sites
Before new Elements and Workflows are released as part of this Resource, our team engages other research groups to evaluate these designs in their labs in real experiments. 
During Alpha testing, 

Dissemination: increase awareness and invite the community to adopt complete products from the Resource: DataJoint and experiment pipelines from the Resource.
Census: Estimate the user populates and collect feedback about their experience.
