# Sustainability Roadmaps

Part of Open Source design means planning ahead with the teams making the tools on which
our software relies. Here, we present Joint Sustainability Roadmaps with teams equally
committed to ensuring sustained software development in service of open and
collaborative neuroscience research.

## DataJoint and Neurodata Without Borders

### Aim
**DataJoint** and **Neurodata Without Borders (NWB)** are two neuroinformatics 
  initiatives in active development. The projects develop independently yet they have
  complementary aims and overlapping user communities. This document establishes key
  processes for coordinating development and communications in order to promote
  integration and interoperability across the two ecosystems.

### Projects and Teams

#### DataJoint

**DataJoint** — https://datajoint.org — is an open-source software framework for
  structuring scientific data in shared databases and automating analysis workflows.
  Research projects use DataJoint to automate their data collection and analysis.

**DataJoint Elements** — https://elements.datajoint.org — is a collection of open-source
  reference database schemas and analysis workflows for neurophysiology experiments.
  The project is funded by the NIH grant U24 NS116470 and led by Dr. Dimitri Yatsenko.

The principal developer of the DataJoint framework and DataJoint Elements is the company
DataJoint — https://datajoint.com.

#### Neurodata without Borders (NWB)

**NWB** - https://www.nwb.org — is a data standard for neurophysiology, providing
  neuroscientists with a common standard to share, archive, use, and build analysis
  tools for neurophysiology data. The project is funded by the NIH grant U24 NS120057
  and led by Dr. Oliver Rubel (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory) and Dr. Benjamin
  Dichter (Catalyst Neuro).

The principal developers of NWB are the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and
Catalyst Neuro.

### General Principles

#### No obligation

The developers of the two ecosystems acknowledge that the roadmap creates no contractual
relationship between them but they agree to work together in the spirit of partnership
to ensure that there is a united, visible, and responsive leadership and to demonstrate
administrative and managerial commitment to coordinate development and communications.

#### Coordinated Development

The two projects will coordinate their development approaches to ensure maximum
interoperability. This includes:

-   coordinated use of terminology and nomenclatures
-   support for testing infrastructure: units testing and integration testing
-   a coordinated software release process and versioning
-   coordinated resolution of issues arising from joint use of the two tools

#### Points of contact

To achieve the aims of coordinated development, both projects appoint a primary point of
contact to respond to questions relating to the integration and interoperability of
DataJoint and NWB.

For 2022, the DataJoint POC is Dr. [Chris Brozdowski](mailto:cbroz@datajoint.com)

For 2022, the NWB POC is Dr. Ryan Ly (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory)

#### Annual Review

To achieve the aims of coordinated development, the principal developers conduct a joint
annual review of the joint sustainability roadmap to ensure that the two programs are
well integrated and not redundant. The contents and resolutions of the review will be
made publicly available.

#### Licensing

The two parties ensure that relevant software components are developed under licenses
that avoid any hindrance to integration and interoperability between DataJoint
workflows and NWB utilities.
