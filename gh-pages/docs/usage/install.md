# Setup instructions for workflows created with the DataJoint Elements

- The following document describes the steps to setup a development environment
  so that you can use the DataJoint Elements to build and run a workflow on your
  local machine.

- The DataJoint Elements can be combined together to create a workflow that
  matches your experimental setup. We have created example workflows (e.g.
  `workflow-array-ephys`, `workflow-calcium-imaging`) for your reference. In this
  tutorial we will install these example DataJoint workflows.

- These instructions can be adapted for your custom DataJoint workflow.

- There are several ways to create a development environment. Here we will
  discuss one method in detail, and will highlight other methods along the way.
  If you have already set up certain components, feel free to skip those sections.

- You will need administrative privileges on your system for the following setup
  instructions.

## System architecture

![Architecture](../img/install_architecture.png)

- The above diagram describes the general components for a local DataJoint
  development environment.

## Install an integrated development environment

- DataJoint development and use can be done with a plain text editor in the
  terminal. However, an integrated development environment (IDE) can improve your
  experience. Several IDEs are available.

- In this setup example, we will use Microsoft's Visual Studio Code.
  [Installation instructions here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

## Install a relational database

- A key feature of DataJoint is the ability to connect with a database server
  from a scientific programming environment (i.e., Python or MATLAB) so that your
  experimental data can be stored in the database and downloaded from the
  database.

- There are several options if you would like to install a local relational
  database server + [Docker image for MySQL server configured for use with DataJoint](https://github.com/datajoint/mysql-docker)

      + [Install MariaDB server](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/binary-packages/)

- Alternatively, for simplicity of this tutorial you can use the DataJoint
  Playground tutorial database located at `tutorial-db.datajoint.io` which has
  already been configured. Please note that the tutorial database should not be
  used for your experimental analysis as the storage is not persistent.

## Install a version control system

- Git is an open-source, distributed version control system for collaborating
  with software development. GitHub is a platform that hosts projects managed
  with Git. As the example DataJoint workflows are hosted on GitHub, we will use
  Git to clone (i.e., download) this repository.

- For your own DataJoint workflow development we recommended that you use Git
  and GitHub for collaboration.

- Many systems come preinstalled with Git. You can test if Git is already
  installed by typing `git` in a terminal window.

- If Git is not installed on your system, [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

## Install a virtual environment

- A virtual environment allows you to install the packages required for a
  specific project within an isolated environment on your computer.

- It is highly recommended (though not strictly required) to create a virtual
  environment to run the workflow.

- Conda and virtualenv are virtual environment managers and you can use either
  option. Below you will find instructions for conda.

  + Miniconda is a minimal installer for conda.  Follow the [installer instructions](
      https://conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) for your operating system.

  + You may need to add the Miniconda directory to the PATH environment
      variable

    + First locate the Miniconda directory

    + Then modify and run the following command
        ```bash
        export PATH="<absolute-path-to-miniconda-directory>/bin:$PATH"
        ```
  + Create a new conda environment
    ```bash
    conda create -n <environment_name> python=<version>
    ```

    + Example command to create a conda environment
      ```bash
      conda create -n workflow-array-ephys python=3.8.11
      ```

  + Activate the conda environment
      ```bash
      conda activate <environment_name>
      ```

## Install Jupyter Notebook packages

- Install the following, if you are using Jupyter Notebook.

  ```bash
  conda install jupyter ipykernel nb_conda_kernels
  ```

- Install the following, for `dj.Diagram` to render.
  ```bash
  conda install graphviz python-graphviz pydotplus
  ```

## Clone and install the relevant repository

- In a terminal window and change the directory to where you want to clone
  the repository

  ```bash
  cd ~/Projects
  ```

- Clone the relevant repository, often one of the workflows

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/datajoint/<repository>
  ```

- Change into the cloned directory

  ```bash
  cd <repository>
  ```

- From the root of the cloned repository directory. Note: the `-e` flag, which will
  will install this repository in editable mode, in case there's a need to modify the
  code (e.g. the workflow `pipeline.py` or `paths.py` scripts). If no such
  modification is required, using `pip install .` is sufficient.
  ```bash
   pip install -e .
  ```
- Install `element-interface`, which contains scripts to load data for many of our
  Elements, and all workflows

  ```bash
  pip install "element-interface @ git+https://github.com/datajoint/element-interface"
  ```

- Items specific to `workflow-calcium-imaging`
    <details>
    <summary>Click to expand details</summary>

  - `element-interface` can also be used to install packages used for reading
    acquired data (e.g., `scanreader`) and running analyses (e.g., `CaImAn`).

  - Install `element-interface` with `scanreader`

    ```bash
    pip install "element-interface[scanreader] @ git+https://github.com/datajoint/element-interface"
    ```

  - Install `element-interface` with `sbxreader`

    ```bash
    pip install "element-interface[sbxreader] @ git+https://github.com/datajoint/element-interface"
    ```

  - Install `element-interface` with `Suite2p`

    ```bash
    pip install "element-interface[suite2p] @ git+https://github.com/datajoint/element-interface"
    ```

  - Install `element-interface` with `CaImAn` requires two separate commands

    ```bash
    pip install "element-interface[caiman_requirements] @ git+https://github.com/datajoint/element-interface"
    pip install "element-interface[caiman] @ git+https://github.com/datajoint/element-interface"
    ```

  - Example `element-interface` installation with multiple packages
  `bash pip install "element-interface[caiman_requirements] @ git+https://github.com/datajoint/element-interface" pip install "element-interface[scanreader,sbxreader,suite2p,caiman] @ git+https://github.com/datajoint/element-interface" `
  </details>

## Set up a connection to the database server

- One way to set up a connection to the database server with DataJoint is to
  create a local configuration file (i.e., `dj_local_conf.json`) at the root of the
  repository folder, with the following template:

  ```json
  {
    "database.host": "<hostname>",
    "database.user": "<username>",
    "database.password": "<password>",
    "loglevel": "INFO",
    "safemode": true,
    "display.limit": 7,
    "display.width": 14,
    "display.show_tuple_count": true,
    "custom": {
      "database.prefix": "<username_>"
    }
  }
  ```

- Specify the database's `hostname`, `username`, and `password`.

  - If using the
    [Docker image for MySQL server configured for use with DataJoint](https://github.com/datajoint/mysql-docker) then the `hostname` will be
    `localhost`.

  - If using the tutorial database, the `hostname` will be
    `tutorial-db.datajoint.io`. And the `username` and `password` will be the
    credentials for your [DataJoint account](https://accounts.datajoint.io).

- Specify a `database.prefix` which will be the prefix for your schema names.

  - For a local setup, it can be set as you see fit (e.g., `neuro_`).

  - For the `tutorial-db` database, you will use your DataJoint username.

- Specific workflows will require additional information in the custom field, including
  paths to data directories, following the convention described in the
  [directory structure section](#directory-structure-and-file-naming-convention). If
  multiple root directories exist, include all in the relevant json array.

## Setup complete

- At this point the setup of this workflow is complete.

## Download example data

- We provide example data to use with the example DataJoint workflows.

- The data is hosted on DataJoint's Archive which is an AWS storage and can be
  download with [djarchive-client](https://github.com/datajoint/djarchive-client).

- Install `djarchive-client`

  ```bash
  pip install git+https://github.com/datajoint/djarchive-client.git
  ```

- In your python interpreter, import the client

  ```python
  import djarchive_client
  client = djarchive_client.client()
  ```

- Browse the available datasets

  ```python
  list(client.datasets())
  ```

- Each datasets has different versions associated with the version of the
  workflow package. Browse the revisions.
  `python list(client.revisions()) `

- Prepare a directory to store the download data, for example in `/tmp`

  ```bash
  mkdir /tmp/example_data
  ```

- Download a given dataset

  ```python
  client.download('<workflow-dataset>',
                  target_directory='/tmp/example_data',
                  revision='<revision>')
  ```

- We will use this data as an example for the tutorial notebooks for each
  workflow. If you want to use for own dataset for the workflow, change the path
  accordingly.

## Directory structure and file naming convention

- The workflow presented here is designed to work with the directory structure
  and file naming convention as described below.

- `workflow-array-ephys`
    <details>
    <summary>Click to expand details</summary>

  - The `ephys_root_data_dir` is configurable in the `dj_local_conf.json`,
    under `custom/ephys_root_data_dir` variable.

  - The `subject` directory names must match the identifiers of your subjects
    in the `subjects.csv script` (`./user_data/subjects.csv`).

  - The `session` directories can have any naming convention.

  - Each session can have multiple probes, the `probe` directories must match
    the following naming convention:

        `*[0-9]` (where `[0-9]` is a one digit number specifying the probe
        number)

  - Each `probe` directory should contain:

    - One neuropixels meta file, with the following naming convention:

      `*[0-9].ap.meta`

    - Potentially one Kilosort output folder

  ```
  <ephys_root_data_dir>/
  └───<subject1>/                       # Subject name in `subjects.csv`

  - Note: the `element-calcium-imaging` is designed to accommodate multiple
    scans per session, however, in this particular `workflow-calcium-imaging`,
    we take the assumption that there is only one scan per session.

  - The `imaging_root_data_dir` directory is configurable in the
    `dj_local_conf.json`, under the `custom/imaging_root_data_dir` variable

  - The `subject` directory names must match the identifiers of your subjects
    in the `subjects.csv` script (`./user_data/subjects.csv`).

  - The `session` directories can have any naming convention
  - Each `session` directory should contain:

    - All `.tif` or `.sbx` files for the scan, with any naming convention

    - One `suite2p` subfolder per `session` folder, containing the `Suite2p`
      analysis outputs

    - One `caiman` subfolder per `session` folder, containing the `CaImAn`
      analysis output `.hdf5` file, with any naming convention

### Run integration tests

- Download the test dataset to your local machine. Note the directory where the
  dataset is saved (e.g. `/tmp/testset`).

- Create an `.env` file within the `docker` directory with the following content. 
  Replace `/tmp/testset` with the directory where you have the test dataset downloaded.
  `TEST_DATA_DIR=/tmp/testset`

- If testing an unreleased version of the `element` or your fork of an `element`
  or the `workflow`, within the `Dockerfile` uncomment the lines from the
  different options presented. This will allow you to install the repositories
  of interest and run the integration tests on those packages. Be sure that the
  `element` package version matches the version in the `requirements.txt` of the
  `workflow`.

- Run the Docker container.
  ```
  docker-compose -f ./docker/docker-compose-test.yaml up --build
  ```
