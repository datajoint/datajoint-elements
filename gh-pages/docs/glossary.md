# Glossary

The following are some terms used in the Resource.

***DataJoint***

> a software framework for database programming directly from matlab and python. Thanks to its support of automated computational dependencies, DataJoint serves as a workflow management system.

***DataJoint Workflow, Experiment Workflow, or simply Workflow***

> a formal representation of the steps for executing an experiment from data collection to analysis. Also the software configured for performing these steps. A typical workflow is composed of tables with inter-dependencies and processes to compute and insert data into the tables.

***DataJoint Pipeline***

> the data schemas and transformations underlying a DataJoint workflow. DataJoint allows defining code that specifies both the workflow and the data pipeline, and we have used the words "pipeline" and "workflow" almost interchangeably.

***DataJoint Schema***

> a software module implementing a portion of an experiment workflow. Includes database table definitions, dependencies, and associated computations.

***DataJoint Elements***

> software modules implementing portions of experiment workflows designed for ease of integration into diverse custom workflows.

***djHub***

> our team's internal platform for delivering cloud-based infrastructure to support online training resources, validation studies, and collaborative projects.
