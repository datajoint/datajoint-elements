3.2. Defining and Prioritizing New Projects
We propose the following criteria for accepting a new experiment modality for support in DataJoint Elements:
At least one successful open-source DataJoint-based precursor project must exists for the modality
The precursor project team is open to interviews to describe in detail their procedures and processes.
The modality (with or without DataJoint) is projected to be in use by a substantial population or research groups, e.g. 100+ labs.  
Tentative agreement has been reached for validating the new workflows with at least three new groups.
