# Datajoint Elements
This is the main page for **DataJoint Elements** â€” a library of software modules for organizing data and computations in neurophysiology experiments. 
The project provides an efficient approach to creating and managing *scientific data workflows*: the complex multi-step methods for data collection, preparation, processing, analysis, and modeling that researchers must perform in the course of an experimental study. 
The work is derived from the developments in leading neuroscience projects that use the [DataJoint framework](https://datajoint.io) for defining, deploying, and sharing their data workflows. 

## Status 
This resource will launch on May 1, 2021.

The overview of the principles of DataJoint pipelines and the goals of DataJoint Elements are described in the position paper "DataJoint Elements: Building Scientific Workflows for Neurophysiology." (prepint to be posted by 03/25/2021)
