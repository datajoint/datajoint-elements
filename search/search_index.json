Matlab conventions are similar and will be described separately. DataJoint Schemas DataJoint allows creating database schemas , which are namespaces for collections of related tables. The following commands declare a new schema and create the object named schema to reference the database schema. import datajoint as dj schema = dj.schema('<schema_name>') We follow the convention of having only one schema defined per Python module. Then such a module becomes a \"DataJoint schema\" comprising a python module with a corresponding database schema. The module's schema object is then used as the decorator for classes that define tables in the database. Elements An Element is a software package defining one or more DataJoint schemas serving a particular purpose. By convention, such packages are hosted in individual GitHub repositories. For example, Element element_calcium_imaging is hosted at https://github.com/datajoint/element-calcium-imaging , and contains two DataJoint schemas: scan and imaging . Deferred schemas A deferred schema is one in which the name of the database schema name is not specified. This module does not declare schema and tables upon import. Instead, they are declared by calling schema.activate('<schema_name>') after import. By convention, all modules corresponding to deferred schema must declare the function activate which in turn calls schema.activate . Thus Element modules begin with import datajoint as dj schema = dj.schema() def activate(schema_name): schema.activate(schema_name) However, many activate functions perform other work associated with activating the schema such as activating other schemas upstream. Linking Module To make the code more modular with fewer dependencies, Elements' modules do not import upstream schemas directly. Instead, all required classes and functions must be defined in a \"linking module\" and passed to the module's activate function. For instance, the element_calcium_imaging.scan module receives its required functions from the linking module passed into the module's activate function. See the corresponding workflow for an example of how the linking module is passed into the Element's module.","title":"Design Principles"},{"location":"design-principles/#design-principles","text":"The following conventions describe the Python implementation.

A precursor project is a project that develops a DataJoint pipeline for its own experiments either independently or in collaboration with our team. We reach out to teams who develop DataJoint pipelines for new experiment paradigms and modalities to identify essential design motifs, analysis tools, and related tools and interfaces.

To ensure higher quality, the following policies have been adopted into the software development lifecycle (SDLC). Coding Standards When writting code, the following principles should be observed. Style : Code shall be written for clear readability. Uniform and clear naming conventions, module structure, and formatting requirements shall be established across all components of the project. Python's PEP8 standard offers clear guidance to this regard which can similarly be applied to all languages. Maintenance Overhead : Code base size should be noted to prevent large, unnecessarily complex solutions from being introduced. The idea is that the larger the code base, the more there is to review and maintain. Therefore, we should aim to find a compromise where we can keep the code base from becoming too large without adding convoluted complexity. Performance : Performance drawbacks should be avoided, controlled, or, at least, be properly monitored and justified. For instance: memory management, garbage collection, disk reads/writes, and processing overhead should be regarded to ensure that an efficient solution is achieved. Automated Testing All components and their revisions must include appropriate automated software testing to be considered for release. The core framework must undergo thorough performance evaluation and comprehensive integration testing. Generally, this includes tests related to: Syntax : Verify that the code base does not contain any syntax errors and will run or compile successfully. Unit & Integration : Verify that low-level, method-specific tests (unit tests) and any tests related coordinated interface between methods (integration tests) pass successfully. Typically, when bugs are patched or features are introduced, unit and integration tests are added to ensure that the use-case intended to be satisfied is accounted for. This helps us prevent any regression in functionality. Style : Verify that the code base adheres to style guides for optimal readability. Code Coverage : Verify that the code base has similar or better code coverage than the last run. Code Reviews When introducing new code to the code base, the following will be required for acceptance by DataJoint core team into the main code repository. Independence : Proposed changes should not directly alter the code base in the review process. New changes should be applied separately on a copy of the code base and proposed for review by the DataJoint core team. For example, apply changes on a GitHub fork and open a pull request targeting the main branch once ready for review. Etiquette : An author who has requested for a code for review should not accept and merge their own code to the code base. A reviewer should not commit any suggestions directly to the authors proposed changes but rather should allow the author to review. Coding Standards : Ensure the above coding standards are respected. Summary : A description should be included that summarizes and highlights the notable changes that are being proposed. Issue Reference : Any bugs or feature requests that have been filed in the issue tracker that would be resolved by acceptance should be properly linked and referenced. Satisfy Automated Tests : All automated tests associated with the project will be verified to be successful prior to acceptance. Documentation : Documentation should be included to reflect any new feature or behavior introduced. Release Notes : Include necessary updates to the release notes or change log to capture a summary of the patched bugs and new feature introduction. Proper linking should be maintained to associated tickets in issue tracker and reviews. Alpha Release Process For the workflows and their revisions, the initial development and internal testing, the code will be released in Alpha . During this phase, we will engage external research teams to test and validate the complete workflows in real-life experiments with our team's engineering support. During this phase, significant design changes may be performed and not all features may be completely developed. However, several features should be usable and suitable for testing and validation. Criteria to participate as validation sites The participating lab/group has an existing DataJoint pipeline for the Element(s) to be connected to The DataJoint pipeline code base is hosted as a Github repository (either public or private) The participating lab/group has existing datasets in the format supported by the Element(s) for the purpose of this validation The participating lab/group has a dedicated point of contact person to work closely with DataJoint\u00ae engineering team for this validation effort Criteria for a successful validation Able to connect the Element(s) to existing pipeline and all schemas/tables declared without errors Successful ingestion of data for at least 2 experimental sessions Inspection/verification that the data are ingested correctly by the participating lab/group - e.g. manual inspection of ingested traces, plotting of spatial footprints, spike trains, etc. to confirm correctness of ingested data Beta Release Process After the initial validation phase, we make the workflows available to the general public with a warning of Beta status and that the released code may be subject to errors and changes. During this phase, feature development should be complete with a focus on collecting user feedback to make design improvements and bug fixes. Official Release Process After gaining confidence of user satisfaction by resolving concerns raised in Beta , the workflows are declared officially released and announced to the community. Maintenance Support Lifecycle Revision of the workflows will be released with a version specification that clearly identifies whether in Alpha , Beta , or Official release status. Quality assurance process will be followed for all iterations and new designs. If the updates require changes in the design of the database schema or formats, a process for data migration will be provided. User Feedback & Issue Tracking All components will be organized in GitHub repositories with guidelines for contribution, feedback, and issue submission to the issue tracker. For more information on the general policy around issue filing, tracking, and escalation, see the DataJoint Open-Source Contribute policy. Typically issues will be prioritized based on their criticality and impact. If new feature requirements become apparent, this may trigger the creation of a separate workflow or a major revision of an existing workflow.","title":"Quality Assurance"},{"location":"management/quality-assurance/#quality-assurance","text":"DataJoint and DataJoint Elements serve as a framework and starting points for numerous new projects, setting the standard of quality for data architecture and software design.

For instance: memory management, garbage collection, disk reads/writes, and processing overhead should be regarded to ensure that an efficient solution is achieved.","title":"Coding Standards"},{"location":"management/quality-assurance/#automated-testing","text":"All components and their revisions must include appropriate automated software testing to be considered for release. The core framework must undergo thorough performance evaluation and comprehensive integration testing. Generally, this includes tests related to: Syntax : Verify that the code base does not contain any syntax errors and will run or compile successfully. Unit & Integration : Verify that low-level, method-specific tests (unit tests) and any tests related coordinated interface between methods (integration tests) pass successfully. Typically, when bugs are patched or features are introduced, unit and integration tests are added to ensure that the use-case intended to be satisfied is accounted for. This helps us prevent any regression in functionality. Style : Verify that the code base adheres to style guides for optimal readability. Code Coverage : Verify that the code base has similar or better code coverage than the last run.","title":"Automated Testing"},{"location":"management/quality-assurance/#code-reviews","text":"When introducing new code to the code base, the following will be required for acceptance by DataJoint core team into the main code repository. Independence : Proposed changes should not directly alter the code base in the review process. New changes should be applied separately on a copy of the code base and proposed for review by the DataJoint core team. For example, apply changes on a GitHub fork and open a pull request targeting the main branch once ready for review. Etiquette : An author who has requested for a code for review should not accept and merge their own code to the code base. A reviewer should not commit any suggestions directly to the authors proposed changes but rather should allow the author to review. Coding Standards : Ensure the above coding standards are respected. Summary : A description should be included that summarizes and highlights the notable changes that are being proposed. Issue Reference : Any bugs or feature requests that have been filed in the issue tracker that would be resolved by acceptance should be properly linked and referenced. Satisfy Automated Tests : All automated tests associated with the project will be verified to be successful prior to acceptance. Documentation : Documentation should be included to reflect any new feature or behavior introduced. Release Notes : Include necessary updates to the release notes or change log to capture a summary of the patched bugs and new feature introduction. Proper linking should be maintained to associated tickets in issue tracker and reviews.","title":"Code Reviews"},{"location":"management/quality-assurance/#alpha-release-process","text":"For the workflows and their revisions, the initial development and internal testing, the code will be released in Alpha . During this phase, we will engage external research teams to test and validate the complete workflows in real-life experiments with our team's engineering support.

Open Precursor Project(s) At least one open-source DataJoint-based precursor project must exist for any new experiment modality to be accepted for support as part of the Resource. The precursor project team must be open to interviews to describe in detail their process for the experiment workflow, tools, and interfaces. The precursor projects must provide sample data for testing during development and for tutorials. The precursor projects will be acknowledged in the development of the component. Rationale: This Resource does not aim to develop fundamentally new solutions for neurophysiology data acquisition and analysis. Rather it seeks to systematize and disseminate existing open-source tools proven in leading research projects. Impact New components proposed for support in the project must be shown to be in demand by a substantial population or research groups, on the order of 100+ labs globally. Validation Roadmap Several new research groups must express interest in becoming the validation sites during the alpha and beta release phases of the project. Our team will work closely with the validation sites to test the components in their workflow and collect feedback during the process. Sustainability For all third-party tools or resources included in the proposed component, their long-term maintenance roadmap must be established.
